	<h1>Speech is better than silence &lt;then &amp;more than writings&gt;</h1> 
	<p>
		&quot;Let thy speech be better than silence, or be silent.&quot; &quot;What we say is importantâ€¦ for in most cases the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.&quot;&quot;If you can't write your message in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sentence, you can't say it in an hour.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>
		&quot;There are always three speeches, for every one you actually gave.&quot;
