	<h1 class="highlight">Element With Class Selector</h1>
	<p>Combining Selectors is a very powerful technique that allows you to more precisely target dumb elements. In this lecture we're going to take a look at some of the most common ways of combining CSS selectors The first one is with element with class selector. As you can see here we have a P element followed immediately without any spaces by a dot big which is a A class selector. And what this expresses is that I want to target every p element that has an attribute class equal to big.</p>
	<p class="highlight">This is p with class hightlight</p>
	<div class="highlight mainpoint">This is the mainpoint of the article</div>
